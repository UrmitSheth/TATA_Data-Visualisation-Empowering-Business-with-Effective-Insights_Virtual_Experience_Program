# TATA iQ Virtual Experience Program – Business Insights & Data Visualization

This repository contains my work for the Virtual Experience Program offered by **Tata Insights and Quants (Tata iQ)**. The program simulates real-world business scenarios and allows participants to explore how data visualization tools like **Power BI** and **Tableau** are used to solve complex business problems and uncover actionable insights.

The experience demonstrates the nature of challenges handled by Tata iQ professionals and aims to mirror the thought process and analytical approach required in business analytics roles.

## Program Structure

The program is divided into 4 hands-on modules:

1. **Framing the Business Scenario**  
2. **Choosing the Right Visuals**  
3. **Creating Effective Visuals**  
4. **Communicating Insights and Analysis**

Each module reflects realistic tasks where participants take the role of a consultant to provide insights to business leaders like the CEO and CMO based on operational and marketing data.

##  Module Overviews

### Task 1 – Framing the Business Scenario
An online retail store hires you as a consultant to review its data and provide insights to the CEO and CMO. The company is performing well and wants to identify revenue-driving factors for strategic planning.

You must:
- Think from a business leader's perspective.
- Draft 4 relevant questions for the CEO and 4 for the CMO.
- Focus on both quantitative and qualitative metrics.
- Use the provided dataset to guide your questioning.

---

### Task 2 – Choosing the Right Visuals
You are asked to select the best type of visual for specific business questions. The visuals should help senior management clearly understand performance trends, strengths, and opportunities — avoiding misinterpretation.

You will:
- Choose visuals for 5 business scenarios in a quiz format.
- Understand data requirements before deciding visual types.
- Ensure each chart conveys insights with clarity and accuracy.

### Task 3 – Creating Effective Visuals
Based on prior tasks, you now build actual visualizations using either **Power BI** or **Tableau**.

You will:
- Clean the dataset by removing invalid data (e.g., negative quantity, incorrect prices).
- Create charts for 4 specific questions from the CEO and CMO.
- Deliver the visuals with the correct format (`.pbix` or `.twbx`) and structure.

Sample requirements include:
- Monthly revenue trends for 2011 (CEO)
- Top 10 countries by revenue (excluding UK) (CMO)
- Top 10 customers by revenue (CMO)
- Regional product demand analysis (CEO)

### Task 4 – Communicating Insights and Analysis
Finally, you present your findings to leadership through a 5-minute recorded video. This includes:
- Your thought process and data-cleaning approach
- Summary of each visual and its business relevance
- Actionable insights that guide strategic decisions, particularly for expansion

This step emphasizes communication skills and translating complex data into executive-level insights.
